# Personal Site

My [personal site](https://willfrank.co.uk) built with [Pelican](http://getpelican.com) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

## Development
To preview the site during development:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/w-frank/w-frank.github.io.git
cd w-frank.github.io
-- development --
./develop.sh
```
Once the basic server has been started, you can preview the site at http://localhost:8000/

## Deployment
```shell
git clone https://github.com/w-frank/w-frank.github.io.git
cd w-frank.github.io
-- add/update content --
./publish.sh "commit message"
```

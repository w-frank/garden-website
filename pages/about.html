    <p>I'm Will, an Electronics Engineer based in Oxford, UK.</p>
<p>I currently work designing scientific instrumentation and control systems for particle accelerators. My interests include: signal processing, harmonic analysis, digital design, embedded systems and FPGA development. I am also more widely interested in the application of electronic and computing technology to biology, ecology and conservation.</p>
<p>You can find me on GitHub.</p>
<p>Outside of the lab, I'm a keen naturalist, gardener, runner and mountaineer. The Travel page contains a record of the countries I have visited and the mountains I have climbed to date.</p>
<p>This site is a space for me to document stuff I do in my spare time. Most of the posts are going to involve electronics, but I might also write about programming or mathematics. It runs on Python 3, using the Django framework with Bower for package management.</p>
<p>All content has been produced my me, with the following exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>External CSS and Javascript libraries including Bootstrap, d3.js etc.</li>
<li>The data for the world map used on the Travel page is part of the d3.js library and licensed under the BSD 3-clause license.</li>
</ul>

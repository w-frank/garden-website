1. Use gloves to protect yourself against irritants in the leaves!
2. Collect a large bundle of comfrey and/or nettle leaves.
3. Chop up the leaves.
4. Pack the chopped leaves tightly into a container with a lid (a large bucket
is perfect!). Use a brick to weigh down the leaves.
5. Keep the container warm (i.e. use a black container positioned in the sun).
6. Mix well daily. This aerates the mixture - foaming indicates that the leaves
are decomposing.
7. When foaming ceases (typically after two or three weeks) draw off the liquid.
8. Dilute the liquid 1:10 for use as a potassium rich liquid plant feed.

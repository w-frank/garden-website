Title: About

I'm Will, an Electronics Engineer based in Oxford, UK.

I currently work designing scientific instrumentation and control systems for particle accelerators. My interests include: signal processing, harmonic analysis, digital design, embedded systems and FPGA development. I am also more widely interested in the application of electronic and computing technology to biology, ecology and conservation.

You can find me on GitHub.

Outside of the lab, I'm a keen naturalist, gardener, runner and mountaineer. The Travel page contains a record of the countries I have visited and the mountains I have climbed to date.

This site is a space for me to document stuff I do in my spare time. Most of the posts are going to involve electronics, but I might also write about programming or mathematics. It runs on Python 3, using the Django framework with Bower for package management.

All content has been produced my me, with the following exceptions:

* External CSS and Javascript libraries including Bootstrap, d3.js etc.
* The data for the world map used on the Travel page is part of the d3.js library and licensed under the BSD 3-clause license.

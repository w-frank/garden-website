Title: About

I'm Will, an Electronics Engineer based in Oxford, UK.

I currently work on scientific control and data acquisition systems for particle accelerators. My interests include: digital signal processing, embedded systems and FPGA development. I'm also more widely interested in the application of technology to issues in biology, ecology and conservation.

This site is a space for me to document stuff I do in my spare time. Most of the posts are going to involve electronics, but I might also write about programming or mathematics.

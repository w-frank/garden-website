Title: About

![img-about](../images/me.jpg)

I'm a plantsperson and gardener. This is a space for me to share my
love of plants and document my explorations in horticulture and botany.

I have been growing flowers, fruits, and vegetables in an organic way ever since
taking over a wild patch at the bottom of my parents garden in my teens. I am
passionate about sustainable, organic gardening and farming practices as well
as gardening for wildlife.

I am also a huge advocate of the physical and mental well-being benefits from
taking part in meaningful activity outdoors.

Title: About

I'm Will, an embedded electronics engineer and designer based in Oxford, UK.

I currently work on scientific control and data acquisition systems for large-scale experimental physics facilities. My interests can be summarised as sensing, control and communication in artificial and biological systems. This includes; signal processing, control theory and embedded systems and FPGA design. I'm also more widely interested in the application of technology to biology, ecology, agriculture and wildlife conservation.

This site is a space for me to document stuff I do in my spare time. Most of the posts are going to involve electronics, but I might also write about programming, mathematics or nature.

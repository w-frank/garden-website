Title: About

My name is Will. I'm an engineer, designer, and writer currently
based in Oxford, UK. My technical interests span embedded systems, digital
signal processing, and control systems, particularly in the fields of audio
electronics, renewable energy, and agricultural technology.

I have a background in the research and development of scientific
data acquisition and control systems, primarily for use on particle accelerators.

This site is for me to share what I've learnt on the [blog](https://www.willfrank.co.uk/),
and archive various projects in my [portfolio](https://willfrank.co.uk/pages/portfolio.html).

I can offer a range of skills and services:

**Hardware design:**

Requirements capture, system-level design, component selection, prototyping, 
analogue and digital electronics, circuit simulation (SPICE), microcontrollers
(Atmel/Microchip AVR/PIC, STM32, Espressif ESP8266/ESP32).

CAD for electronics panels and enclosures using AutoCAD.

**PCB Design:**

Schematic capture, PCB layout and routing. Multi-layer, mixed-signal, high-speed
PCBs. Using OrCAD or KiCad.

**Firmware and software development:**

Skilled in C, C++, and Python. Experienced with Arduino, ESP8266/ESP32,
Raspberry Pi and STM32 ecosystems. Basic system administration on Linux.

**Technical documentation:**

Product brochures, web sites, and other marketing.

User, installation, and maintenance guides, manuals, tutorials.

Requirements and specifications, design documents, test procedures.

Project budgets and schedules.

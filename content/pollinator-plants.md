Collectively our gardens are home to a wide range of living creatures and form an increasingly beneficial habitat for wildlife.
The way we choose to manage our outdoor spaces can therefore make a big difference to the natural world.
By growing more wildlife-friendly plants we can attract a wider range of species into our gardens, creating a haven for nature.

These plants are some of the best flowers, wildflowers and herbs in our small back garden that wildlife absolutely love:

1. Foxgloves *(Digitalis)*
2. Hardy geraniums/cranesbills *(Geranium)*
3. Forget-me-not *(Myosotis)*
4. Marigolds *(Calendula)*
5. Marjoram *(Origanum majorana)*
6. Chives *(Allium schoenoprasum)*
7. Dahlia (single or semi-double, *Dahlia*)
8. Ivy *(Hedera)*
9. Comfrey *(Symphytum officinale)*
10. Wild strawberries *(Fragaria vesca)*

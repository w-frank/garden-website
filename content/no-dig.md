No-dig gardening is a growing method that avoids cultivation of the soil. 
It relies on the regular application of organic mulches such as compost,
well-rotted manure, or leaf mould. The material is applied on the soil surface
in a layer at least 5-15 centimeters deep. The action of worms, insects, fungi,
and microbes then breaks down the mulch material and works it into the soil.
The living soil community, in particular earth worms, help to improve the soil
structure by digging tunnels that aerate the soil and improve drainage. Hoeing
and other forms of soil disturbance are minimally used; no pesticides,
herbicides, fungicides or synthetic fertilisers are used.

The thick layer of mulch retains moisture more effectively, and slows leaching
of soil nutrients. It also helps to suppress annual weeds by blocking their
access to light and can provide essential nutrients for the plants.

No-dig is much less energy intensive than traditional methods of cultivation
that rely on digging the soil each year, but is reliant on having plentiful
organic matter available. It is also useful to remove any perennial weeds by
hand before starting a no-dig bed.

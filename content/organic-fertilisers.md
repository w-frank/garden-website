Summary: The best eco-friendly and sustainable alternatives to using peat compost in the garden.

## 1. Farmyard Manure

A traditional material used to maintain and improve soil fertility and structure.
It consists of straw or other bedding, mixed with well rotted animal faeces and
urine. A full range of nutrients is released into the soil. 

## 2. Garden (home) Compost

Home made compost has a host of benefits including; recycling garden and kitchen
waste without needing transport.

## 3. Composted Municipal Waste

Essentially the same as garden compost, but as it normally composts at a much
higher temperature weeds and diseases have been inactivated. 

## 4. Spent Mushroom Compost
A by-product of the mushroom industry. It is typically straw capped with chalk,
which gives a characteristically high pH. This makes it useful for increasing
soil pH as an alternative to liming but it must not be used for acid loving
plants (ericaceous).

## 5. Leaf Mould
Leaf mould is made from well rotted leaves of decidous trees and makes a highly
prized low nutrient compost. 

## 6. Pine Needles
An extremely acidic medium that is almost resistant to decomposition. Valued for
the propagation of calcifuge plants such as rhododendrons and heathers.

## 7. Chipped Bark
Primarily used a surface mulch. It does not decompose readily which means it can
last a long time on the surface. 

## 8. Green Manures
This is the practice of growing plants to:

* cover bare ground
* out compete weeds
* reduce soil erosion
* capture soluble nutrients
* add organic matter
* increase micro-organism activity
* develop and maintain soil fertility and structure

The plants used are typically agricultural crops such as clover or trefoil that
cover the ground quickly. The seeds are sown in autumn when there are no
overwintering plants. The green manure is then dug in or cut, left to wilt and
dug into the soil.

## 9. Coconut Coir
Coconut coir is made from the fibers between the shell and outer covering of
coconuts. It has excellent water-retention capabilities, holding up to 10 times
its weight in water. Adding it to soil also aids in proper draining and aeration,
allowing plant roots to get plenty of water and room for oxygen.

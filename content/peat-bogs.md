Peat bogs are an often overlooked but very important habitat in the UK. Peat 
bogs are a unique wetland ecosystem which takes many thousands of years to form
and provides habitat for a diverse range of plants, insects and birds.
<br/><br/>
Formed of dense wetland, the waterlogged conditions and the bogâ€™s acidity
prevents the vegetation from completely decaying when it dies. Instead, it
builds up very slowly over thousands of years to become a thick layer of peat.
<br/><br/>
Peatland is the earth's largest carbon store (storing 42% of all soil
carbon) and harvesting it releases this carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere.
<br/><br/>
Going peat free in your garden is one of the best ways you can help protect our
peatlands.

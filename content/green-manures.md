Green manures are used in vegetable plots and in organic growing systems
to cover bare ground (normally outside the growing season. e.g. over winter).
The seeds are typically broadcast sown in autumn when there are no overwintering plants.
Once established, the green manure is then dug in or cut, left to wilt and then dug into the soil.

The benefits of green manures are:

* Cover bare ground
* Out compete weeds
* Reduce soil erosion
* Capture soluble nutrients (that would otherwise be leached)
* Add organic matter
* Increase soil micro-organism activity
* Develop and maintain healthy soil fertility and structure

Green manures are typically agricultral plants that quickly cover the
ground and put on a large amount of leaf.

Here are 12 plants that make excellent green manures:

* *Lupinus angustifolius* (Bitter blue lupin)
* *Medicago lupulina* (Trefoil)
* *Trifolium hybridum* (Alsike clover)
* *Trifolium incarnatum* (Crison clover)
* *Trifolium pratense* (Essex red clover)
* *Triognella foenum-graecum* (Fenugreek)

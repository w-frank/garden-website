Summary: Much ado about mulches...

## What is mulching?

Mulches are materials added to surface of the soil. To be effective the material
needs to be laid thickly. Most can be applied at any time, as long as the soil
is moist. If the purpose is for insulation then the mulch should be applied
after the soil has warmed up in Spring. Perennial weeds should be removed prior
mulching and material should be kept away from the base of woody stems to avoid
softening, and help to prevent diseases.

## What is mulching?

Mulches are organic materials added to surface of the soil that are essential for soil health.
To be effective the material needs to be laid thickly. Most can be applied at any time,
as long as the soil is moist, but autumn, when crops have been harvested and you donâ€™t want to leave the soil exposed over winter, is a particually good time. If the purpose is for insulation then the mulch should be applied after the soil has warmed up in Spring. Perennial weeds should be removed prior
mulching and material should be kept away from the base of woody stems to avoid
softening, and help to prevent diseases.

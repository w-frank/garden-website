## What is mulching?

Mulches are materials added to surface of the soil. In this post I'll focus on
organic materials that are essential for soil health. To be effective the
material needs to be laid thickly. Most can be applied at any time, as long as
the soil is moist, but if the purpose is for insulation then the mulch should
instead be applied after the soil has warmed up in Spring. Autumn, when crops 
have been harvested and you donâ€™t want to leave the soil exposed over winter,
is a particually good time. Perennial weeds should be removed prior to mulching
and material should be kept away from the base of woody stems and trunks to
avoid softening, and help to prevent diseases.

## Benefits of mulching

Mulching can provide one or more of the following benefits:

* A decorative finish (e.g. chipped bark on borders)
* Improved soil structure
* Suppression of weeds
* Moisture retention
* Protection of the soil surface and reduced erosion
* Maintainance and increase of soil organic matter
* Encouragement of benefical soil organisms
* Retention of heat in the soil
* Protection of edible crops from contact with the soil

## Materials for mulch

Many organic materials are used as mulches including farmyard manure, garden
compost, mushroom compost, composted municipal waste, leaf mould, chipped bark,
composted straw and green manure.

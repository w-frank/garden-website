Summary: A guide to designing a Swift caller: how to help protect Swifts in your home and garden using Arduino.

Swifts *(common swift - Apus apus)* are summer migrants to Britain, arriving to our shores in late April or early May and departing as early as July. This fleeting visit involves journeys of epic proportions from sub Saharan Africa. They certainly live up to their name, in some cases travelling up to 800 km (500 miles) a day!

However, these dynamic aerial gymnasts are under threat. The numbers of British Swifts have fallen by more than half since 1995. The exact cause remains unclear, and there may be many contributing factors, with declining insect populations and a changing climate commonly cited. Fortunately, there is one easily identifiable and potentially solvable issue - the distinct lack of suitable nest sites in modern buildings.

Since Roman times, Swifts have adapted to live closely along side us. They have abandoned their historic natural sites in cliffs, caves and ageing trees, preferring instead to build their saliva cemented straw nests in holes under the eaves of houses and in church towers. Modern housing developments simply donâ€™t have the nooks and crannies that Swifts rely on, and many older buildings where the birds have built their nests in the past are being tidied up and have any cavities wired up against Pigeons, keeping Swifts out in the process.

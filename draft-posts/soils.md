# Soil Science

## Overview
The soil is one of the most important and complex ecosystems on the planet. Organisms breakdown matter. Respiration oxygen to CO2, water and heat. Living and dead organisms and humus. 0.5-5% volume organic.
Peat 35-100% organic matter.
Plant roots,  earthworms, insects, fungi bacteria.
Fungi - produce enzymes that can breakdown lignin in wood.
Bacteria - nitrogen fixing (legumes). Get carbohydrates from plant.
Earthworms - 
Non-living - dead animals and plants, animal waste, green manures. Provides food for organisms. Airates the soil.
Humus - water retention, soils warms up more quickly in spring (dark colour)

## Composting
Organic matter decomposition - soil organims. 
Particle size decreases.
Energy transfer to organisms.
Waste energy as heat.
Food, water, and air. Temperature - kills weeds and pathogens. pH 6-8.
Keep aerobic - not too wet or dry. Airated. 
Reduce landwill waste. Benefical end product.
Mulches and fertiliser.
Better stability and structure.
Increase water retention.
Imporve drainage.
Encourage benefical organisms.
Grass cuttings, leaves, bark, prunings.
Undercooked fruit and veg, newspapers and cardboard.
Avoid perennial weeds and weeds with seeds.
Dairy, meat and cooked food waste attracts flies and rodents.
Wood can be difficult in normal conditions.
Human or pet waste, diseased plants, herbicide plants, glossy paper.
Browns - woody, carbon rich.
Greens - soft, lush, nitrogen rich - make proteins and enzymes.
1:1 - 1:3 greens to browns. Well mixed.
Turn regularly. 4-5 weeks in summer, 8-10 weeks in summer.
Minimum size of 1m3.

Wormery - fast, 18-25 degrees. Mesh sieves. Reservoir at bottom - rich liquid fertisier.
Green garden and kitchen waste.
Leaf mold - oak, hormbeam or beech leaves. Tougher leaves need to be chopped up.
Evergreen leaves to be chopped and add to compost heap.

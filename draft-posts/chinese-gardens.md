Chinese gardens are designed to imitate the natural landscape in miniture,
particually the mountains and lakes of China. The purpose was to emphasise the
beauty of nature, whist creating harmony beteen humans and nature. Some are
designed to be walked through and the whole garden usually cannot be seen at 
once. Instead deliberate, well composed scenes, are created and then framed to 
be viewed, as the paintings in a gallery.

Lakes and ponds are common features in Chinese gardens. Water symbolizes
communication and dreams as well as complementing the natural landscape elements
of rocks and trees.

Stones are an integral part of the garden. Often used to symbolise mountains, 
they are selected for their texture, nature or shape. Limestone rocks that have
been eroded into interesting shapes are the most highly prized.

Plants are used in the garden for their colour, texture, and fragrance. Plants
are selected to evoke a feeling of the season. Sound is also an important 
element, and the sound of rain falling on leaves adds to the atmosphere of the 
garden.

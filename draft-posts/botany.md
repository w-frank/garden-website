The scientific study of plants, called botany - from three Greek words,
botanikos (botanical), botane (plant or herb), and boskein (to feed), and the
French word botanique (botanical).

Scientific principles in botany
* Evolution
* Natural selection

Plant anatomy - internal structure of plants
dendrochronology - deals with determining past climates by examining the width
and other features of tree rings
paleobotany - involves the study of plant fossils

Plant physiology - concerned with plant function

Plant morphology - form and structure of plants

Plant taxonomy involves describing, naming, and classifying organisms. Plant
systematics is a related field but is broader than taxonomy. It is the science
of developing methods for grouping organisms

Plant geography, the study of how and why plants are distributed where they are
The allied field of plant ecology, which is the study of the interaction of
plants with one another and with their environment

Genetics - lant breeding, which has greatly improved the yields and quality of
crop plants, and genetic engineering. Genetic engineering involves the transfer
of genes from one organism to another and has already improved the pest, frost,
and disease resistance of some crop plants
genomics - focuses on genes and their function

Cell biology (previously called cytology) - the science of cell structure and
function

Economic botany and ethnobotany, which focus on practical uses of plants and
plant products

Each tree you see outside your window probably contains a billion atoms, many of
which may well have been in the bodies of your ancestors.

## Interesting plants

The leaves of sensitive plants (Mimosa pudica) fold within seconds after being
disturbed or subjected to sudden environmental changes.

The tiny underwater traps of bladderworts (Utricularia) snap shut in less than
one-hundredth of a second.

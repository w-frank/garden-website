Avoiding climate collapse is incompatible with continual economic growth.

Find things to do other than shopping:
* Deep pleasure from experiences that are not for sale and do not cost anything. Time in nature, or time
with our loved ones.
* Love of nature, and desire to experience the natural world more intensely.

* Buy better quality and keep things for longer.
* Buy from charity shops first.
* Where possible send items for repair or mend them yourself.

Transcendental writers:
* John Muir
* Henry Thoreau
* Ralph Emerson

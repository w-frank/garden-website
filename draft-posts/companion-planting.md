Companion planting is the technique of growing mutually beneficial plants
together in the garden (known as a mutualism in ecology). It begins with the
understanding that, although in part managed by human hands, our gardens are 
fundamentally natural ecosystems with a miriad of complex and interconnected
dependencies and relationships.

Beneficial plants can help to attract insect pollinators, beneficial predators,
and help soil structure and fertility.

The principle of companion planting is exemplified by the 'Three Sisters'
planting scheme used by the Iroquois people of North America. The technique of
planting corn, beans, and squash in close proximity was the physical and
spiritual sustainer of life. The corn provides support for the beans to climb to
reach the sun, the beans fix atmospheric nitrogen into the soil, and the large
leaves of the squash shade the ground; preserving soil moisture and suppressing
weeds. All three provide nourishing food for people.

Here is a table of known beneficial companion planting combinations:


For example, one species of plant provides shelter
for another, protecting it from wind and maintaining
the humidity it requires; another plant, by co-operating
with certain bacteria, provides nitrogen for itself and
itâ€™s neighbours; fungi extract minerals from the soil and
exchange them with green plants for sugars; insects
pollinate plants and receive nectar in exchange; closely
related species of animals consume slightly different
diets and thus avoid competition with each other; water-
loving plants and animals colonise marshy ground,
making it productive without any need for drainage.
